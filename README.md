## 🚀 Install

One line. No global install, no `npm i -g`. Always use `npx`:

```bash
npx lazycodex-ai install
```

This is shorthand for `npx --yes --package oh-my-openagent omo install --platform=codex`. For a fully autonomous, no-TUI setup:

```bash
npx lazycodex-ai install --no-tui --codex-autonomous
```

## ⚡ Commands

LazyCodex installs these as OmO commands for Codex. Invoke them with the
`$command` syntax shown by the installer.

| Command | Type this | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$ulw-loop` | `$ulw-loop "task" [--completion-promise=TEXT] [--strategy=reset\|continue]` | Self-referential loop that runs until Oracle-verified completion. Caps at 500 iterations in ultrawork mode, 100 in normal mode. |
| `$ulw-plan` | `$ulw-plan "what to build"` | Prometheus strategic planner. Writes a plan to `plans/<slug>.md`. Never writes product code. |
| `$start-work` | `$start-work [plan-name] [--worktree <path>]` | Executes a plan until every checkbox is done. Prints **ORCHESTRATION COMPLETE**. |

Full documentation lives at [lazycodex.ai/docs](https://lazycodex.ai/docs).

## Use the built-in workflows

LazyCodex should be judged by the features it actually installs. It is a thin
Codex distribution for OmO: project memory, planning, execution, verified
completion, skills, hooks, model routing, and diagnostics.

### 1. `/init-deep` creates project memory

`/init-deep` generates hierarchical `AGENTS.md` context. It scores complex
directories, writes local guidance near the code that needs it, and gives future
agents landmarks before they edit.

Use it when the repository is too large to explain from memory. Run it again
when the shape of the codebase changes.

### 2. The three command pillars stay up front

Use `$ulw-plan` when the work needs decisions before implementation. It writes a
plan to `plans/<slug>.md` and does not touch product code.

Use `$start-work` when a plan is ready. It executes the checklist with durable
Boulder progress and stops only when the plan is complete.

Use `$ulw-loop` when the task should keep moving until the result is verified by
evidence instead of a hopeful status update.

### 3. Skills cover specialized work

The command layer stays simple. The skill layer adds specialist judgment for the
actual work:

| Feature | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `/init-deep` | Hierarchical project memory through `AGENTS.md` |
| `$ulw-plan` | Decision-complete planning before code changes |
| `$start-work` | Durable plan execution with Boulder progress |
| `$ulw-loop` | Verified completion for open-ended tasks |
| `review-work` | Multi-angle post-implementation review |
| `remove-ai-slops` | Behavior-preserving cleanup of AI-looking code |
| `frontend-ui-ux` | Polished UI surfaces |
| `programming` | Strict TypeScript, Rust, Python, or Go discipline |
| `LSP` | Diagnostics, definitions, references, symbols, and renames |
| `AST-grep` | Structural search and rewrite across code |
| `rules` | Project instructions from AGENTS, rules, and instruction files |
| `comment-checker` | Feedback after edit-like operations |

## 💤 What is this?

**LazyCodex** is the **lazy way** to get [OmO (oh-my-openagent)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) up and running.

Think [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), but for Codex.

OmO is the best agent harness: discipline agents, parallel orchestration, multi-model routing, skills, hooks, and more. LazyCodex wraps it so you don't have to think about setup.

> _"LazyVim made Neovim usable for the rest of us. LazyCodex does the same for Codex."_

## 🧩 What you get

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🤖 **Discipline Agents** | Sisyphus orchestrates Hephaestus, Oracle, Librarian. A full AI dev team |
| 🔀 **Parallel Execution** | Multiple agents working simultaneously on subtasks |
| 🎯 **Multi-Model Routing** | Automatic model selection per task category |
| 🛠️ **Skills System** | Extensible skill library for specialized tasks |
| 📋 **Hooks & Lifecycle** | Pre/post hooks for every agent action |
| 🔧 **Zero Config** | Sensible defaults, override when you want |

## 🧠 Why different GPT models appear

Do not be surprised if an OmO/LazyCodex run shows models like `gpt-5.2`
with `xhigh`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, or newer equivalents like
`gpt-5.5` with `xhigh`. That is intentional.

OmO does not blindly spend your best model on every subtask. Its source
defines task categories and fallback chains so the agent can pick the most
appropriate model for the job: `quick` routes to `gpt-5.4-mini` for small
edits, `ultrabrain` uses a high-reasoning GPT model for hard logic, and
agentic coding paths can use Codex-tuned GPT models when available. See
[`openai-categories.ts`](src/src/tools/delegate-task/openai-categories.ts)
and [`model-requirements.ts`](src/packages/model-core/src/model-requirements.ts).

The point is quota discipline: use the strongest model when the task needs
deep reasoning, use a cheaper/faster model when that is enough, and keep
parallel agent work efficient instead of burning premium quota on routine
steps. This is benchmark-driven routing, not random model churn:

- [GPT-5.2](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/) is documented by
  OpenAI as stronger at code review, bug finding, and complex tool use; the
  announcement notes that its maximum API reasoning effort uses `xhigh`.
- [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.3-codex)
  is OpenAI's Codex-tuned model for agentic software engineering, with public
  coding-agent benchmarks such as SWE-Bench Pro, Terminal-Bench 2.0, and
  OSWorld Verified reported in the
  [GPT-5.3-Codex announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex).
- [GPT-5.4 mini](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4-mini-and-nano/)
  is positioned for efficient everyday coding, computer use, and subagents;
  that is why lightweight OmO tasks can land there instead of spending a
  frontier reasoning model.

## 🏗️ Architecture

LazyCodex is a thin distribution layer. The core engine is [oh-my-openagent (OmO)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent), included as a submodule under `src/`.

```
lazycodex/
├── src/                     → oh-my-openagent (submodule)
├── packages/
│   └── web/                 → Next.js 15 + Tailwind v4 + opennextjs-cloudflare
│                              (deployed to lazycodex.ai via Cloudflare Workers)
├── .github/workflows/       → web-ci.yml + web-deploy.yml
├── README.md
└── ...
```

LazyCodex is part of the [omo.dev](https://omo.dev) project. **omo in Codex**, packaged for the lazy.
